# Number Guessing Game (Logic-Only)

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game (Logic-Only)**! 🎉

This project focuses purely on the **JavaScript** logic behind a **number guessing game**. It generates a random number between `0` and `100`, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program will tell you if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## 📝 **Description**

This is a fun and simple **Number Guessing Game** built with **JavaScript** logic. 
- The program randomly generates a number between `0` and `100`.
- You then have to guess the number.
- After each guess, it tells you if the guess was:
    - **Too Low**: Increase your guess.
    - **Too High**: Decrease your guess.
    - **Correct**: Congratulations! 🎉

## ⚙️ **How it Works**

1. **Random Number Generation**:  
   The game randomly generates a number between `0` and `100`.
   
2. **User's Guess**:  
   The user is prompted to guess a number.
   (but in this i am generating anothor number as an input)

4. **Feedback**:
    - If the guess is **too low**, the system tells the user to increase the number.
    - If the guess is **too high**, the system tells the user to decrease the number.
    - When the user guesses correctly, a **"Congratulations!"** message appears.

5. **Repeat**:  
   This process continues until the correct number is guessed.

## 🔧 **Potential Enhancements**

Feel free to make the game more interesting by implementing some of the following features:

- **Guess limit**: Add a limit on the number of guesses allowed (e.g., 10 guesses).
- **Track attempts**: Count and display how many guesses it took to guess the correct number.
